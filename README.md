Financial Analytics Dashboard

Project Overview
The Financial Analytics Dashboard is a full-stack web application designed to empower financial analysts with robust tools for tracking, analyzing, and reporting on company transactions. It provides an intuitive interface for dynamic data visualization, advanced filtering, and configurable CSV export functionality, enabling users to gain actionable insights from their financial data.


Objective
To develop a comprehensive financial application that offers:
* An interactive dashboard for visualizing financial trends.
* A powerful transaction listing with search, sort, and filter capabilities.
* Reliable error handling through user-friendly alert chips.
* A flexible CSV export system for customizable data downloads.


Use Case
Financial analysts can leverage this dashboard to:
* Track and Analyze: Monitor company income and expenses over various periods.
* Visualize: Understand financial trends through dynamic charts (e.g., Revenue vs. Expenses, category breakdowns).
* Interact: Efficiently find specific transactions using advanced search, sort, and filter options.
* Generate Reports: Export customized transaction data to CSV for further analysis or reporting.

User Flow
1. Authentication: Users securely log in using a JWT-based authentication system.
2. Dashboard Access: Upon successful login, users are directed to an interactive dashboard displaying key financial analytics and a detailed transaction table.
3. Data Interaction: Users can dynamically filter, search, and sort transactions within the table to pinpoint specific data points.
4. Report Generation: Users configure desired columns for CSV export via a dedicated modal.
5. File Download: Once the report is generated on the server, the CSV file automatically downloads to the user's browser.


Core Features
1. Authentication & Security
* JWT-based System: Secure user login and logout.
* Secure API Endpoints: All critical backend routes are protected with token validation.

2. Financial Dashboard
* Visualizations:
    * Revenue vs. Expenses trends over configurable periods (Monthly, Quarterly, Annually).
    * Summary metrics (Balance, Revenue, Expenses, Savings).
* Transaction Table:
    * Paginated display for efficient browsing of large datasets.
    * Responsive design for various screen sizes.
* Filtering: Multi-field filtering by Date, Amount, Category, Status, and User.
* Sorting: Column-based sorting with clear visual indicators for ascending/descending order.
* Search: Real-time search functionality across all relevant transaction fields.


3. CSV Export System
* Column Configuration: An intuitive interface allows users to select precisely which transaction fields they want to include in the exported CSV.
* Auto-download: Generated CSV reports automatically trigger a file download in the userâ€™s browser.

Getting Started (Local Development Setup)
Follow these steps to set up and run the Financial Analytics Dashboard on your local machine.


Prerequisites
* Node.js: v18.x or higher (recommended)
* npm: v9.x or higher (comes with Node.js) or Yarn
* MongoDB: A running MongoDB instance (local or cloud-hosted like MongoDB Atlas).
* Git: For cloning the repository.

1. Clone the Repository
First, clone the project repository to your local machine:


git clone https://github.com/Shubham-Vetal/Finance_Analytics.git
cd Finance_Analytics

2. Backend Setup
Navigate to the backend directory (adjust if your backend is in the root or a different sub-directory).
cd backend # Or adjust to your backend directory name, e.g., 'cd server'

Install backend dependencies:
npm install # or yarn install

Create a .env file in your backend directory and add the following environment variables. Replace placeholder values with your actual configuration:
PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string_here # e.g., mongodb://localhost:27017/finance_db
JWT_SECRET=a_very_secret_key_for_jwt_signing # Generate a strong, random string

Build the TypeScript code and start the backend server:
npm run build # Compiles TypeScript to JavaScript in 'dist' folder
npm start     # Starts the Node.js server (e.g., 'node dist/server.js')

The backend server should now be running, typically on http://localhost:5000.
3. Frontend Setup
Open a new terminal window and navigate to the frontend directory (adjust if your frontend is in the root or a different sub-directory).
cd ../frontend # Or adjust to your frontend directory name, e.g., 'cd client'

Install frontend dependencies:
npm install # or yarn install

Create a .env file in your frontend directory and add the following environment variables:
REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:5000/api # Adjust if your backend API path is different

Start the frontend development server:
npm start # or yarn start

The frontend application should now open in your browser, typically at http://localhost:3000.

API Documentation
This section provides a summary of the backend API endpoints. All endpoints are hosted on the backend server (e.g., http://localhost:5000).
